        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p class="main">
            This recipe creates a delicious and moist Texas Sheet Cake. It starts with a mix of white sugar and flour,
            combined with a mixture of melted butter, water, and cocoa powder. After adding baking soda, buttermilk,
            eggs,
            and vanilla extract, the batter is poured into a greased jelly roll pan and baked until done. For the rich
            frosting, a combination of butter, cocoa powder, and milk is heated and mixed with confectioners' sugar and
            chopped pecans. Once the cake has cooled, the frosting is poured over the top, creating a sweet and nutty
            finish
            to this classic dessert.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 11x17 jelly roll pan.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Combine the white sugar and flour in a large bowl. In a small saucepan, melt 1 cup of butter and
                    combine
                    it
                    with water and 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. Stir the mixture over medium heat until the butter
                    is
                    melted
                    and everything is well combined. Pour this melted butter mixture over the sugar and flour, then
                    beat
                    everything together well. Add the baking soda, buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract, and beat
                    the
                    batter
                    until smooth. Finally, pour the batter into the prepared pan.

                    Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center
                    of the
                    cake
                    comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack.

                    In a small saucepan, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of butter, 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder, and

                    Stir
                    over medium heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is well combined. Beat the powdered

                    into
                    the butter mixture until the frosting is smooth. Stir in the pecans, then pour the frosting over
                    the
